# agents in llmango!!!
I spent the last week working getting to understand agents. I see there effectivness. Wether you want structured singular flows or free running multi agent experiences they have many usecases.

Now I want to bring it to golang!!

I love golang and its ecosystem for llms is lacking. So I'll do some work and then let you guys critique!

I built llmango before which allows simplifcation of prompts
