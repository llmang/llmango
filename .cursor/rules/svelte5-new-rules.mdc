okay now lets make the individual goal page that uses its own styling for goals and for prompts look at @prompts.templ for propmts and @goals.templ to see the ifnormation that we used for those pages and what we need to include look through @lib for any reusable components we may need, 

look at @llmangoAPI.svelte.ts for data fetching etc 

USE SVELTE 5 SYNTAX NOT SVELTE 4

DO NOT JUST COPY THE FUCKIGN TEMPLATE FILES AS THESE ARE MESSY AS SHIT 

JUST USE THEM FOR WHAT WE NEED AS ENDPOINTS NOTHING ELSE

WE HAVE GLOBAL STYELS IN @index.css IF we need reusbale components put them in @lib if we want to make. page specific compponenets put them in the same directory as the page. For styling if a style is not page specfic then it should go in the index.css IF it is page specific and won't be reused then KEEP IT in the styel section of the page/component

svelte 5 uses onclick NOT on:click DO NOT USE A COLON in onclick 

we can use states and derived remember that
